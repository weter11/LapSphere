# Mini-panel design (gkrellm-style compact mode)

Status: **DRAFT for discussion.** No application code has been written.
Companion evidence document: [`panel-spike.md`](./panel-spike.md).

Base: `5c57bc7` (branch `feat/mini-panel` from `origin/lapsphere`).
Measurement environment for the claims below: **X11 / XFCE / xfwm4 only.**
Everything Wayland is `NOT TESTED` and is designed for on the assumption
that it degrades to a no-op, not on the assumption that it works.

---

## Goal

Add a compact, always-visible "panel" mode to the existing GUI, in the spirit
of gkrellm: a single undecorated strip, a few rows or one row of meters,
draggable anywhere, showing the hardware you care about at a glance. It is a
**mode of the same window**, not a second window and not a second process.

Non-goal: replacing the Statistics page, or adding new data sources. The panel
renders a chosen subset of what Statistics already shows.

---

## Accepted decisions

### ADR-1 — Mode switching happens inside one process, via `ViewportCommand`

**Decision.** Full mode and panel mode are two states of the *same* eframe
process and the *same* root viewport. Switching mutates the window with
`ViewportCommand::{InnerSize, MinInnerSize, Resizable, Decorations,
WindowLevel}`. The single-instance guard (the `io.lapsphere.Gui` D-Bus name)
is untouched, as is the process lifecycle. Restarting the process remains
available as a fallback, not as the mechanism.

**Evidence.** All five commands were exercised at runtime on X11 and all five
work; 300 round trips produced a **+16 kB** RSS delta and a correct final
window state, with 313 external `xprop` samples showing clean alternation and
no stuck or intermediate geometry. See panel-spike §2 and §4(г).

A panel-shaped window can also be created **directly** through
`ViewportBuilder` with no large-window flash at all (frame 0 already
260x72, `outer == inner`, panel-spike §2). That is the path for "start in
panel mode".

**Rejected: restart the process to change mode.** Simple and always correct,
but it drops the D-Bus connection, re-runs discovery, flickers the tray icon,
and discards the poll scheduler. Unacceptable for a mode toggle.

**Rejected: a second `egui::Viewport` (a second native window).** egui
supports it and it would give independent size, but it introduces a second
GL surface and complicates the tray's single-window mental model. It also
buys nothing here: we want the *same* window reshaped, not a new one.

**Cost accepted.** X11 re-frames the window on every `Decorations` toggle, so
the restored position is not preserved across a switch (measured: ended at
0,21 rather than the pre-test 300,200). Position must be re-applied, not
assumed. Off-screen position requests are clamped by the WM rather than
rejected, so the panel must clamp against monitor size itself.

---

### ADR-2 — Panel size is a function of the selected elements only, never of data availability

**Decision.** The panel's width and height are computed **solely** from which
elements are enabled and their fixed layout metrics. They do **not** depend
on whether data has arrived, and they do not reflow when data changes.

* An element whose data is unavailable renders as `—` (em dash) in a slot
  that is **already reserved at full width**. No relayout, no width change,
  no reflow on the first successful poll.
* The per-core CPU graph is **one bar of fixed height**, not one bar per
  core. The number of cores can change (SMT toggled at runtime, or a
  different machine reading the same config), so per-core bars would change
  the window height. A single fixed-height strip does not.

**Rationale.** gkrellm panels have a stable footprint; a meter that resizes
the window when a dGPU drops off the bus or a gamepad disconnects is
unusable, because you cannot place it. Reserving width for absent data is
the price of a window that never moves under the user's cursor.

**Rejected: hide elements with no data.** The panel would change size
whenever a device appeared or disappeared, and the user's click target would
move. Directly contradicts the goal.

**Rejected: reflow to fit available data.** Same objection, worse: the
layout would depend on daemon timing, so the same config would produce
different windows on different runs.

**Consequence for the config schema.** Every element needs a declared fixed
width and height contribution, decided at design time, not measured at
runtime. This is why the config format (open question Q1) has to carry
layout metrics rather than just a boolean per element.

---

### ADR-3 — Wayland and X11 are both supported, and no-op is an acceptable outcome

**Decision.** Keep the current dual-backend build (`eframe` features
`wayland, x11`, unchanged). A window command that does not take effect is a
**harmless no-op** — the panel still draws, just at the size the compositor
chose. The panel must not depend on:

* **window position** — Wayland does not expose it
  (`ViewportInfo.outer_rect` is documented as always `None` on Wayland), and
  the compositor owns placement. The panel is positioned by the user
  dragging it, and its position is a *hint* on Wayland and a *request* on X11.
* **always-on-top** — the only window-level primitive, and the one most
  likely to be restricted by mutter/kwin for a non-fullscreen client. If
  `WindowLevel(AlwaysOnTop)` does not stick, the panel is an ordinary
  window. That is a degraded experience, not a broken one.

**Not tested.** Every Wayland claim in panel-spike is `NOT TESTED`: this host
has no Wayland session, no compositor and no passwordless sudo. The design
above is chosen *because* it is the option that degrades most gracefully, not
because Wayland behaviour was observed.

**Rejected: gate the panel behind X11.** Rejected on the grounds that we
cannot demonstrate the X11-only alternative is better on the machines we
cannot test. Degrading gracefully is the honest default.

**Rejected: shell out to `xdotool`/`wmctrl` to place the panel.** Adds a
runtime dependency, breaks on Wayland entirely, and is redundant given
`ViewportCommand` already does the job on X11.

### ADR-4 — In panel mode, poll only the selected subset, and only via cache-backed getters

**Decision.** In panel mode the UI polls only the components the panel
actually shows: `cpu`, `gpu`, `memory`, `fans`, `battery`, plus `wifi` and
`gamepads` **if those elements are selected**. Components whose elements are
all disabled are not polled at all. Every getter the panel uses is
**cache-backed**: the daemon's `hardware_monitor` job fills one shared
`HARDWARE_CACHE` (`daemon/src/main.rs:31`, refreshed by the `hardware_monitor` poll job at
`daemon/src/main.rs:332-345`), and the D-Bus getters only clone out of it
(`daemon/src/dbus_interface.rs:73-107, 265-273`). So narrowing the UI poll
set costs **no extra hardware access** — it only stops the GUI from
marshalling JSON it will not draw.

**There is no `GetGpuInfoFull` method.** The brief assumed one; the interface
does not have it. Verified by introspecting the live interface — the full
method list contains `GetGpuInfo`, `GetGpuClockRanges`, `GetGpuCoreOffsetLimits`,
`GetGpuMemoryOffsetLimits`, and no `*Full` variant. The expensive part is not
a separate method but a field **inside** `GetGpuInfo`: every `GpuInfo` carries
a `process_snapshot` with a per-process list. Measured payload: `GetGpuInfo`
2 452 bytes, `GetCpuInfo` 2 463, `GetFanInfo` 239, `GetWifiInfo` 552,
`GetStorageDeviceInfo` 255, `GetGamepadInfo` 7, and `GetDaemonLogs` **735 087**.

So the rule is: **the panel never polls `logs`** (735 kB per call), and
GPU process lists are not rendered in panel mode. If a cheaper GPU getter is
wanted later, adding one is a daemon-side change and out of scope here.

**Existing precedent.** The `logs` component is already gated by exactly this
kind of policy: `UI_FRAME_FRESH_MS` / `LOGS_TAB_ON_SCREEN`
(`gui/src/app.rs:56-90`) stop the callback unless the Logs tab is on screen
and a frame was painted within 5 s, registered at `gui/src/app.rs:442`. The
mechanism to reuse is `RefreshCoordinator::UpdateInterval`
(`gui/src/polling_scheduler.rs`), which already exists and is currently
unused for this purpose.

**Evidence for why it matters.** The live measurement ran 12 components
concurrently and consumed 684 updates over 120 s with `queue_max=10/100` and
`blocked=0` — the pipeline is nowhere near saturation today. So narrowing the
poll set is a **battery and CPU argument, not a stability argument**, and
should be presented that way rather than as a fix.

**Rejected: poll everything, filter at draw time.** Simplest, and today's
behaviour. Costs D-Bus traffic and JSON allocation for data nothing reads
(735 kB per `GetDaemonLogs` call is the extreme case, already mitigated for
the Logs tab but not for other unused components).

**Rejected: one new `GetPanelData` D-Bus method returning exactly the
selected fields.** Attractive — one round trip, minimal payload — but it is a
daemon interface change with its own versioning and compatibility burden,
and it duplicates the cache. Deferred; revisit if the poll set proves too
coarse in practice.

## Interface

**In the main window.** A toggle button in the existing top bar
(`gui/src/app.rs:886`, the `draw_top_bar(ui)` call; defined at `gui/src/app.rs:706`) switches to panel mode. It is
the only place the mode can be entered from, other than config at startup.

**In the panel.**

* A **back button** — returns to full mode in the same process. Placed at a
  fixed position (leading edge of the panel) so it does not move as elements
  change.
* An **element-selection menu**, opened by a small affordance next to the
  back button. Element set, drawn from what the Statistics page already has
  (`gui/src/pages/statistics.rs`): hostname / system name, CPU load graphs
  (the single fixed-height strip of ADR-2), CPU load percentages, CPU
  frequency, CPU temperature, GPU name, GPU load, GPU temperature, GPU
  frequency, GPU VRAM, memory used / total, memory percentage, fan speeds and
  temperatures, battery percentage, battery status, WiFi signal, WiFi SSID,
  gamepad name, gamepad battery.

Selection is **per-mode persistent**, not a transient toggle: it is written to
`settings.json` and restored on next start, so the panel looks the same every
time it appears.

**Note on element identity.** "Hostname" is not currently a Statistics
element. `GetSystemInfo` returns product name, manufacturer and BIOS version
(`gui/src/pages/statistics.rs:145-156`), and `GetMachineId` exists on the
daemon. Deciding which of these is "hostname" is part of Q1.

---

## Open questions

**Q1 — Config schema for the panel in `settings.json`.** Needs: the element
list, ordering, per-element flags (visible, units, decimals, graph vs
number), the fixed width/height each element contributes (ADR-2 makes these
mandatory data, not derived values), and gamepad slot handling. Open
sub-questions: does the schema hardcode the element enum or accept arbitrary
strings (unknown entries must degrade to `—`, not crash); is ordering a list
of ids or a map with an index; are widths in points or character cells;
and how are gamepad slots numbered when a second controller appears. Note
`AppConfig` (`common/src/types.rs:829`) already has `statistics_sections`
with `show_*` booleans and poll rates — the panel config should probably
follow that shape rather than invent a new one.

**Q2 — What does closing the panel window do when the tray is enabled?**
Today `gui/src/app.rs:877-882` converts a close request into
`CancelClose` + `Visible(false)` when the tray is on, so the window hides
rather than exits. Should the panel follow the same rule (close = hide to
tray, restore from tray) or actually quit? A panel is a persistent
fixture, so "close" meaning "hide" is probably right — but then a panel user
who never opens the tray has no way back. Needs a decision.

**Q3 — When, if ever, to move the channel drain into `logic()`.** The spike
**refuted** the original motivation: over 600 s of `Visible(false)` with a
live daemon, `prod == cons == 3534` and `ui()` was called 1 645 times, so the
existing drain in `ui()` keeps up and moving it to `logic()` fixes nothing
(panel-spike §1б, §1д). It would only matter under a **WM iconify**, where
`ui()` provably stops (frozen for a measured 20 s). So: is the iconify case
in scope? If not, drop the step. If yes, `logic()` is the right hook and the
justification is iconify, not tray-hide. Related: a panel that the user
minimizes should arguably keep updating state, which is the same argument.

**Q4 — Queue policy.** The 100-slot channel (`gui/src/app.rs:325`) was never
under pressure in any measurement (`queue_max` 10/100, `blocked=0` over both
120 s visible and 600 s hidden). So this is **not** a fix for an observed
problem. The question is whether to adopt `try_send` + drop-oldest for
staleness-prone data (a CPU load reading 8 s old is worthless; a new one
should replace it), or keep `send().await`. The tradeoff is that `try_send`
changes back-pressure semantics for the Tuning page, which may have actions
where dropping is wrong. Suggests a split: `watch`/latest-value semantics
for telemetry, `try_send` or a queue for actions.

**Q5 — Should the tray click wake the event loop explicitly?** A tray click
does not wake the loop today; it is only seen on the next `ui()` call, i.e.
within 500 ms, and only because `ui()` keeps running while `Visible(false)`.
That is an accident of `ViewportInfo::visible()` returning `None` on X11, not
a designed behaviour. Giving the ksni thread a cloned `egui::Context` to call
`request_repaint()` would make it robust (and would fix the iconify case).
Small, but it is an app change outside the panel's scope.

**Q6 — What is the first thing to fix, given the measured latency?** With a
visible window, update→draw latency is **min 0.1 / avg 222 / max 484 ms**,
bounded entirely by the single `request_repaint_after(500ms)`
(`gui/src/app.rs:917`). A live meter in a 72-point-tall panel will visibly
lag. This is independent of the panel and worth doing first (staged step 1).

---

## Staged implementation plan

One commit each. No code in this PR.

1. **`request_repaint` on data arrival.** When a `HardwareUpdate` is
   consumed (or arrives), request an immediate repaint instead of waiting for
   the 500 ms timer. Improves the existing Statistics page too, and is the
   single change that makes a live panel usable. *Prerequisite: nothing.*
   Expected effect: avg latency 222 ms → low tens of ms.
2. **Move the channel drain into `logic()`** — *only if Q3 concludes the
   iconify case is in scope.* Otherwise skip. Per the spike this is a no-op
   for `Visible(false)`. *Prerequisite: Q3 answered.*
3. **Panel mode in `AppState` and settings.** Add the mode enum and the
   `show_*` config surface following the `statistics_sections` shape; persist
   and reload. No drawing yet. *Prerequisite: Q1 answered.*
4. **`pages/panel.rs` with a fixed layout and `—` placeholders.** Fixed
   widths per ADR-2, reserved slots, single fixed-height core strip. Draws
   with whatever data is in `AppState`. *Prerequisite: step 3.*
5. **Narrow the polled component set in panel mode.** Use
   `RefreshCoordinator::UpdateInterval` to park unselected components at a
   long interval (or add a pause/unregister). Never poll `logs` in panel
   mode. *Prerequisite: step 3; needs the pause mechanism.*
6. **Window switching via `ViewportCommand`,** plus mode and position
   persistence (X11), with clamping against monitor size (ADR-1) and a
   no-op-tolerant path for Wayland (ADR-3). Start-in-panel-mode goes through
   `ViewportBuilder` to avoid the flash. *Prerequisite: steps 3-5.*
7. **README section** describing panel mode, the element list, and the
   Wayland caveats. *Prerequisite: step 6.*

Steps 1 and 2 are independent of the panel and could ship on their own.
Steps 3-6 are one feature; splitting them further would ship a mode that
draws but does not switch, or switches but does not poll.

---

## What is deliberately not decided here

* Whether the panel can be dragged by any part of its surface or only by a
  dedicated handle (interacts with Q2 and with ADR-3's position story).
* Whether multiple panels are ever wanted (out of scope; would change ADR-1).
* The exact element→width table (blocked on Q1).
* Whether panel mode should be startable from the CLI (`--panel`) alongside
  the existing `--tray`.
